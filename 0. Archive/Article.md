## Abstract
Writing an efficient code to numerically solve a problem has many points and complications. Therefore, years of coding experience are necessary to be able to correct the syntax errors of the program and extract the correct numerical results. Our initiative in this article is to present a format that enables a coder to avoid making many frequent errors and obtain the desired answers more easily and accurately.
