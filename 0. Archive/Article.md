# Fortran Framework

## Abstract
Writing an efficient code to numerically solve a problem has many points and complications. Therefore, years of coding experience are necessary to be able to correct the syntax errors of the program and extract the correct numerical results. Our initiative in this article is to present a format that enables a coder to avoid making many frequent errors and obtain the desired answers more easily and accurately.

## Introduction
In the title of this article, coding with Fortran is emphasized. But using this format in other programming languages also opens the way. Because an experienced coder knows that the major part of a code is its algorithm design, and this itself is independent of the language used to write the code. This format is in twelve steps in the form of explanatory lines with a sign! The first line divides the program into separate parts. In this article, we have tried to briefly explain the advantages of each step. It is better to copy these explanatory lines, like boards, in the program and finally write the desired code step by step according to the guide boards. This method has been tested by a number of students who have been at different levels of programming. Finally, the efficiency of this format prompted us to introduce and publish it in order to improve the coding speed and accuracy of other scholars. Those who are interested can get programs written with this format from the author.

## Introduction of program steps
### 1. Registration of program and programmers:
It is appropriate for the coders to introduce themselves at the beginning of each program and register their contact details. This work sometimes creates valuable scientific connections with other researchers and in a way the authors introduce themselves with this method and show their ability to attract the cooperation of others. It is also necessary to write a description of the program, the date of writing and its review for future reference.
