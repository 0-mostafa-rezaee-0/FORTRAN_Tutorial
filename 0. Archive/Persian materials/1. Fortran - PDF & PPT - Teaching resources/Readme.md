# Variables
Variables in Fortran are divided into four categories: Integer, Real, Character, and Logical.

```
Integer  i
Real*8   p      ,q        ,r
```

# Calculation operations and their precedence
In Fortran, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations can be easily done with +, -, * and / symbols.
Note: Power operations are performed with the "**" symbol
The precedence of operations in Fortran is as follows:
1. Calculation of the expression inside the parentheses and library functions
2. Power
3. Multiplication and division
4. Addition and subtraction

# Structure of Fortran programs
A structure called General Structure is suggested for writing programs.
Note: The extension of the old programs written with Fortran was For, but the extension of the new Fortran program is F90

# Data input
1. Data entry by the user
```
- Read(*,*) x
```
2. Data entry by the programmer
```
- Pi=3.14
```
- Complex numbers are written as ordered pairs:
Z = a + bi
(a,b)
```
Ii=(0.,1.)
```
